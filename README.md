# HunterSim-v2

HunterSim-v2 is a C++ reimplementation of the original HunterSim final project found at https://github.com/2003abdulhadi/HunterSim
To run and launch, clone the repo and run make in the directory where the repo is located in on your local machine
If the simulation runs too slow, you can adjust the sleep times of the ghost and hunters at the end of their respective update functions
I will implement a way to do this in the view... eventually :)
